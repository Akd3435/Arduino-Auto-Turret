# Arduino-Auto-Turret
Install Arduino IDE and compiler for Python code (Preferably VS code)

In order to run the Arduino turret follow the steps:
1. First upload the code in Arduino.
2. After the uploading is done in the Arduino run the Python code for face tracking.
Note: First we need to make the subject stand in front of the laptop's camera approximately 6 feet away and point the turret on the subject. This step is required because we are using a laptop's camera which is a 2-Dimensional camera, therefore, we need to set the turret at some starting point. Refer the video for more information.s
